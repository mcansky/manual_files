# APT

Debian is one of the longest running and more popular GNU/Linux distribution out there. Ubuntu was started as a fork of it to provide an easier way for most people to have an easy to install and easy to use Linux based operating system.

Apt is the base package manager on Debian and was inherited by Ubuntu. While the later also provides with an alternative to it you can still use apt to install and manage your packages.

## Sources

Apt uses a list of packages sources called "sources" that you can find in /etc/apt/sources.list and the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. Those are remote or local repositories of packages.

You generally don't have to worry about them but in some cases you might want to add more sources to get additional packages.
Since Debian and Ubuntu are using a slow cycle of release you can rely on private repositories to bring you some more fresh packages.

## Staying up to date

Just like with a git repository you need to keep your local list of packages up to date with the remote repositories. To do so you need to update it :

```# apt-get update```

This will fetch the updated list of packages for you to use. You also need to do an update when you add a new source for example.

Once you have done this step you can either install packages or upgrade all of them :

```apt-get upgrade```

This will ask you a few questions after showing you a list of packages to update.

## Installing packages

To install a package you only need one simple command :

```apt-get install tmux```

If apt knows about that package it will show you the package it's going to install and proceed with the installation.

If you don't want to have to answer questions because you know you will always say Yes you can use the '-y' paramater.

## Searching for a package

Now you are not sure about the name of a package. You can search through the index to figure that part out :

```apt-cache search tmu```

This will return you a list of packages matching the string. That can be pretty big lists so get your grep/ack ready to be used.

Nowadays Ubuntu usually catch the command missing exceptions and provides with a list of packages that do provide the command you tried to use.

## Viewing package details

You can also view details about a package by using the show command :

```apt-cache show tmux```

This will show you details about the package such as the version, the maintainer, a description, the size of it etc ... Quite handy to check if the package you are going to install is the one you actually want.

## Uninstalling a package

You can remove a package using the uninstall command :

```apt-get uninstall tmux```

Be aware that it will not uninstall the dependencies.

## Installing a package from file

You can sometimes have a package file (.deb) to install. Some people package their apps like this for easy release. You can install such package file by using the install command and passing the file as param :

```apt-get install tmux-0.0.1.deb```

## Epilogue

Apt is simple to use and very straight forward. More advanced functions are also available and tools such as dpkg complement it powerfully. Yet most of the time apt is enough.
