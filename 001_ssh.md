# SSH - basics & advanced

SSH is the handitool to connect to remote servers. It replaces Telnet in a very advantegous way. First reason is security of course, the other is all the things you can do with Unix based SSH clients beside remote login.

## Password and others

Usually you start with connecting to an account a mate of yours create on a server in the states. For simplicity he just asks you for a username, set yourself a temporary password and request you to change it on your first login.

That's ok and is very fast to setup. But then you get an account on another server and another ... (For whatever reason). You start setting up the same password everywhere etc ... Not great.

The solution is to use keys.

## Keys

You can create pairs of keys using different algorythms and that makes SSH far more secure. You need not only to know a passphrase but also have a specific private key to get in.

```
> ssh-keygen
```

This command will ask you for a key name and a passphrase generate both a public and private key. You then just have to send the public key to your mates.

Those files will, by default, sit in your personal ssh directory (```~/.ssh```).

What your friend will do is copy the content of the public key file into the user "authorized_keys". Once it's in there you can SSH into that server.

If you have multiple keys usually your ssh client will sort things through, if it can't you can always pass the specific one by using the ```-i``` option.

```
> ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key foo@bar-server
```

## SSH proxying

When you get serious things going with several critical servers you don't expose them to the whole world. Those hosts will seat in a private network, shielded from the internet by other machines. To get to those hosts you use a gateway, or jump box that sits on the fence.

In practice you will start by ssh in to the jump box then ssh into the host you want. There is a way to automate the jump by specifying a proxy host (the jump box).

```
# TODO proxy config
```

Actually you can define a couple more things in the config especially host names, user names, port or specific keys to use for specific hosts.

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host bar-server
  User bob
```

That one defines bob as user to use when connection to bar-server, it will be used unless you pass a specific one in the command directly.

```
Host bar-server
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/foo2_rsa
```

That one defines ```~/.ssh/foo2_rsa``` as the key to use when connection to bar-server.

```
Host bar-server
  ProxyCommand ssh jump-box nc 10.0.0.42 22
```

That one is the one I wanter to show. It tells SSH to first ssh into jump-box to then ssh into bar-server (aka 10.0.0.42) on port 22.
You could totaly use a different username for the jump box too.

For that last case you will need to have your ssh public key in both host for each the users used.

If you are paranoid and need to do several hops (go through different jump boxes before reaching the destination) you can do that too, search on the internet you will find the answers.

## Being the mate / Managing the server

Now let's say you are the guy managing those machines. If you use services such as AWS, DigitalOcean or Rackspace they will set your ssh key in every host you create by default. Now you can create user accounts.

Let's say you have a "bob" account for some remote access or service on a server. If you want your friend Gill to connect to it you can ask for a SSH public key and insert it, on a single line in the ```~/.ssh/authorized_keys``` of that user. Make sure you have the algorythm part in, that it's a single line. You don't need the end part with a name or username but it's handy to figure out which key belongs to Gill and which one belongs to Oliver.

If you are using a jump box you will need to get the public key on both the jump box and the final host.

## Usual mistakes

When moving keys around you need to be careful about file permissions. Your private keys in particular need to be kept secure and most SSH clients will refuse to do anything if a private key is visible by more than just you.

Usual good practice is to set the right to a very non permissive 400 :

```
> chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ras
```

This will not only give you and only you read rights but also just read rights. That way, you can't do anything to that key by mistake.


## SSH Port Tunnel

A very good advanced feature is the ability to open a tunnel between on host and another and forward a port of the remote machine to the local one. It's especially handy for services that are on hosts in privat enetworks.

Let's take the example of ElasticSearch. ES is always kept in private networks, since there is very little protection setup on it.

To create the tunnel you need to ssh in the server and add the ```-L``` option. That option needs to be followed by the local port you want to tie the remote port to, followed by the ip on which the service is listenning to on the remote host, followed by the port the service is listenning on.

For ES listenning on IP 10.0.0.42 on port 9200 that we want to forward to the port 9201 locally that gives us : ```9201:10.0.0.42:9200```.

Your remote host can be behind a jump box or not that does not matter. You just follow the -L option with the usual ```bob@some-host``` :

```
ssh -L 9201:10.0.0.42:9200 bob@some-host
```

You can then check with netcat or directly with a simple curl request on that port if it's alive and well, listenning.

## SSH Proxy

The other trick that's good to know is to use a remote host as HTTP proxy through SSH. It's handy if you are moving around and don't want to expose your traffic to a public wifi for example.

To setup such proxy you need to open up a SSH connection using the ```-D``` option :

```
ssh -D 12345 bob@some-host
```

Once that is done you will have a shell open to the remote host. You don't really care about it (or you can).

To use it you need to set your browser or your operating system to use it as SOCKS Proxy and use the value "localhost" and the port "12345" (defined with the -D option) in those settings.

Once that is done your http and https traffic will go through that SSH, encrypted, tunnel to get out to the internet from the remote server.

## Epilogue

You can learn a lot more details and handy other options in the man page : ```man ssh```. ```scp``` is also a good pick to look into as it's the "SSH" power copy of file. Some options differ between the two so be sure to check the man page.

Speaking of details and manpage check out ```man ssh_config```Speaking of details and manpage check out ```man ssh_config```.

Annnddd That's it.
