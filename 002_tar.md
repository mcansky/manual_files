# Tar

Tar is the Unix go to for archiving. Contrary to the windows RAR and ZIP habits Tar handles archiving (packing several files into 1) and compressing (reducing the size of that one file) in separate ways.

By definition actually Tar only archive files and directories. Compression is an additional option to be passed when creating or opening an archive.

The most used compression is Gzip (.gz, -z) but you can also see bzip2 (.bz2, -j).

## Archiving

You can create an archive with the following :

```
tar -cvf some.tar some_dir/
```

```-c``` like create, ```-v``` like "verbose" (to see the list of files added).

You can then add more files to the archive with the following :

```
tar -rvf some.tar other_dir/
```

## Compressing

Compressing can be simply done by adding the ```-z``` option. Don't forget to add the ".gz" extension to the file. While not lethal to the process the omission of the extension can be a little troublesome to your futureself.

```
tar -cvzf some.tar.gz foo_fir/
```

## Unarchiving / uncompressing

The unarchiving and uncompressing of a tar archive is very simple :

```
tar -xvzf some.tar.gz
```

Notice the use of the ```-z``` option here since we (apparently) have a compressed archive.

The ```-x``` option is for "extract".

A very useful option for this is ```-C``` : it allows to tell tar _where_ to uncompress the content of the archive. Handy if you 

## Epilogue

Tar is less and less used directly nowadays as most file browser directly handle archiving and compressing with a few click but it's always a good to have when you are working in command line and scripts.
